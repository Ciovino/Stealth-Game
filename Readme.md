# Stealth Game
- Move your character to the finish line, without alerting the guards
- The faster you move, the more noise you will make

## How to run the game
You will need to compile and create you own *.exe* file:
- Open the command window (CMD or Powershell) and move to this folder;
- Type the following command: `gcc .\source\main.c .\source\Screen.c .\source\Random.c .\source\Colori.c -o StealthGame.exe`
- Now run the game with: `.\StealthGame.exe`

## Why this project?
This is just a fun way to refresh my C programming skills

### Updates on the project
- **05/06/2024** : I had to pause programming for a while, beacause of university. Right now i only have the last two exams before graduating in computer engineering, so i hope i will have all the time i want during the summer to fully commit to this project.
- **04/02/2025**: *Good news*: I graduated in CS, and now started the master degree in Data Science. *Bad news*: I completly forgot about this project. I don't think anybody notice, but that's ok. I will try and be more consistent from now on.

## What i had trouble with
In this section (as the name suggest) I'm gonna write a small summary of what were the obstacles found during the coding, more or less detailed
