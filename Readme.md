## Re-learing project
I had to pause programming for a while, beacause of university. Right now (05/06/24 it), i only have the last two exams before graduaiting in computer engineeiring, so i hope i will have all the time i want during the summer to fully commit to this project. 
This is just a fun way to refresh my C programming skills, before starting the master degree in Data Science/Quantum Engineeiring (yet to decide).

### What i had trouble with
In this section (as the name suggest) I'm gonna write a small summary of what were the obstacles found during the coding, more or less detailed
